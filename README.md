# 🎬 Movie Search App  

This project is a **responsive React application** that allows users to **search for their favorite movies** and access key details, such as **release dates** and **descriptions**. It leverages the **TMDB API** to fetch movie data and uses **Appwrite** to track and display the most searched movies within the app.  

To optimize performance, the app implements **debounce** to reduce unnecessary API requests while users type in the search bar. Additionally, frequently searched movie titles are **ranked at the top** based on user searches, making it easier to discover trending films.
